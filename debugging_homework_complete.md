Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
Answer - The purpose of a breakpoint is to pause the application and launch the debugger console

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
Answer - The line of code on a breakpoint does not run when you start debugging. the debugging console comes up before the line
is executed giving the user the control to initiate the running of the line.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?
Answer - By clicking step over which will run the current line of code with the breakpoint and then stopping on the line directly below it.

4. What does the step into command do?
Answer - Step into will switch to the method called on the breakpoint and pause at the top of that method allowing the useer to view that.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Answer - Evaluate Expression allows you to run a single java code to call methods on the created instances of objects
Evaluate Code Fragment allows you to run multiple methods and multiple lines of code and also create temporary variables to store information.
